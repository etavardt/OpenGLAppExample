## Log
    ??/??/???? Started this from following an OpenGL tutorial on 'TheCherno's
               youTube channel.  But there are elements of my own and at least 
               one idea from a youTube user's comment on a "TheCherno"s video.
    01/12/2023 Abandoned GLEW for GLAD do to ease of use no libs just headers
               and a c file to build and link yourself in your project.  No are
               those binaries compatible issues.  The only issue with GLAD is the
               website configureing of those files.  It is a bone and a bane,
               having to rely on a website that may or maynot be there in the
               future. Whether it is due to connectivity or being nologer supported.
